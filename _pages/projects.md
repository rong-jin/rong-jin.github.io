Performed SPH simulations to model projectile impacts on various magnesium alloys under adiabatic conditions, and validated simulation results against tensile tests on EDM-fabricated microtensile samples with high-speed DIC measurements. Accurately captured stress contours and backface deflections at key impact velocities, thereby revealing detailed impact dynamics. Simulation of projectile impact on a target plate using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method was performed under adiabatic and room-temperature conditions. Material properties were adopted from literature values, and the simulations showed good agreement with experimental results—despite minor fluctuations likely due to discontinuities from cracks or fragments during impact. Notably, the simulation results at impact velocities of 1.2 km/s and 2.4 km/s closely match experimental data, while discrepancies such as backface deflection and asymmetry are observed in other cases. Additionally, the simulation visualizes otherwise unmeasurable data, such as von-Mises effective stress contours, thereby revealing stress distributions at various impact velocities and time intervals.
