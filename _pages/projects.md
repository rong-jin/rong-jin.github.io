## Simulation of High-velocity Impact on Mg Alloys

Jan. 2023 â€“ Jun. 2024
</div>


Performed SPH simulations to model projectile impacts on various magnesium alloys under adiabatic conditions, and validated simulation results against tensile tests on EDM-fabricated microtensile samples with high-speed DIC measurements. Accurately captured stress contours and backface deflections at key impact velocities, thereby revealing detailed impact dynamics.
