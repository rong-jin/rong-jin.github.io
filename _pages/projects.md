## Simulation of High-velocity Impact on Mg Alloys

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: smaller;">
Jan. 2023 – Jun. 2024
</div>


Performed SPH simulations to model projectile impacts on various magnesium alloys under adiabatic conditions, and validated simulation results against tensile tests on EDM-fabricated microtensile samples with high-speed DIC measurements. Accurately captured stress contours and backface deflections at key impact velocities, thereby revealing detailed impact dynamics.

## Vietnam Quang Trach Continuous Ship Unloader

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: smaller;">
Apr. 2022 – Dec. 2024
</div>

Led the mechanical design and implementation of a Continuous Ship Unloader (CSU), overseeing the selection and calculation of critical components—including the drive system, chains, buckets, rotary feeder, and slewing gear. Conducted comprehensive finite element structural analyses to verify overall stability and accurately determine wheel load distributions under varied conditions, thereby optimizing performance and reliability. Facilitated the seamless integration of system components to ensure a smooth transition from design to engineering execution, proactively addressing manufacturing and installation challenges. Collaborated closely with the client to refine design parameters in line with operational requirements and maintain compliance with international standards (ISO, ANSI, ASME, etc.), ultimately delivering a high-performance and reliable bulk material unloading solution.


## Korea POSCO Grab Type Ship Unloader

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: smaller;">
Sep. 2020 – Jun. 2022
</div>

Directed the replacement project for the No. 9 grab-type ship unloader (GTSU) at Pohang Port, overseeing comprehensive design selection for mechanical mechanisms—including detailed design and selection calculations for externally procured components such as motors, reducers, and brake discs—as well as the overall structural design. Employed finite element analysis to assess structural stability under load combinations and perform precise wheel load calculations, ensuring the equipment met user requirements while achieving optimal performance and reliability. As the lead for design and project construction, managed component-level task assignments, supervised system integration, and collaborated closely with manufacturing teams to resolve production challenges. Coordinated with the client to refine design requirements, ensure adherence to relevant standards, and successfully deliver a high-performance bulk material handling solution.
