We use ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) to calibrate the parameters of the material model in high-velocity impacts, integrating the experimental data with the numerical models. By iteratively updating the simulation inputs with observations, DA minimizes errors from numerical and experimental sources. We employ smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations for suitability with sequential DA methods and utilize the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reconcile differences between observations and simulations. This work advances DA integration into high-strain-rate modeling and highlights the potential of merging experimental data with advanced numerical techniques for high-velocity impact challenges, improving model calibration and parameter estimation for more accurate simulations.
