The analysis of high-velocity impacts is essential in fields such as defense, aerospace, and materials science, encompassing a diverse array of scenarios, including projectiles impacting land vehicles and supersonic aircraft traversing particulate-laden environments. This study presents a comprehensive computational examination of high-velocity impacts utilizing the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Impact scenarios involve a stainless-steel projectile colliding with a magnesium alloy target plate at velocities ranging from 1.2 km/s to 2.4 km/s. To model the behaviors of both the projectile and the target under various strain rates and temperatures, we employ meticulously calibrated plasticity, fracture, and equation of state models. Our simulations detail the evolution of von-Mises effective stress and temperature fields at different impact velocities. Principal material failure mechanisms such as spalling and adiabatic shearing are observed. Furthermore, we quantify the dissipation of the impact's kinetic energy into the kinetic and internal energies of both the projectile and the target. Additionally, we analyze the temporal evolution of these energy components during the impact process and the distribution of energy across SPH particles at critical instances. The findings indicate that the kinetic energy of the target reaches its zenith when the shock wave attains the rear face, subsequently stabilizing after complete penetration. With an escalation in impact velocity, the proportion of kinetic energy in the target and internal energy in the projectile increases in significance for energy dissipation, whereas the contribution of the target's internal energy diminishes.
