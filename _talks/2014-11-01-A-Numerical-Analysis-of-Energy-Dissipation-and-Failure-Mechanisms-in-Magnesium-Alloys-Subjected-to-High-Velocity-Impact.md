The presentation performd a computational analysis of high-velocity impacts (1.2â€“2.4 km/s) between stainless steel projectiles and magnesium alloy targets using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Simulations reveal principal failure mechanisms, quantify energy dissipation into kinetic and internal energies, and demonstrate velocity-dependent energy partitioning. Results highlight peak kinetic energies at shock-wave arrival and evolving energy distributions during penetration.
