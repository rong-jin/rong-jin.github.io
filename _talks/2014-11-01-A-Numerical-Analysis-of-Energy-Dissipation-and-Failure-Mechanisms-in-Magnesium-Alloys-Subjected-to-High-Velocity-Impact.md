High-velocity impact analysis is crucial in defense, aerospace, and materials science, involving scenarios like projectiles hitting vehicles and aircraft in particle-rich environments. This study uses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for a computational analysis of impacts, examining stainless-steel projectiles against magnesium alloy targets at 1.2 to 2.4 km/s. We employ calibrated models for plasticity, fracture, and equations of state to simulate von-Mises stress and temperature fields at various velocities. Key failure mechanisms, such as spalling and adiabatic shearing, are observed. We measure how impact kinetic energy converts into kinetic and internal energies of both the projectile and the target, analyzing their temporal evolution and SPH particle energy distribution. The target's kinetic energy peaks when the shock wave reaches the rear, stabilizing post-penetration. Higher impact speeds increase the significance of the target's kinetic and projectile's internal energy for dissipation, while the target's internal energy contribution decreases.
