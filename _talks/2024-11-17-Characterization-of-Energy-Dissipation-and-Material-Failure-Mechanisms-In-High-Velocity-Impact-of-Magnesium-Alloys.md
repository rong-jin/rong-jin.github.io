Our investigation focuses on magnesium alloys impacted by a steel ball, using varied treatments like solutionizing with aluminum and zinc and peak aging. We use a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model to simulate impacts up to 2.4 km/s, with models for plasticity, fracture, and equations of state. The SPH model is validated against data such as target deflection, projectile residual velocity, and perforation size. We identify failure mechanisms like wave propagation, spalling, shearing, cracking, and fragmentation, analyzing fragment velocities to assess protection efficiency. We quantify energy dissipation in kinetic, strain, and heat energy, studying spatial and temporal changes to characterize transition regimes. We conduct parametric studies on impact velocity, obliquity, and plate thickness to explore effects on failure and dissipation, aiming to improve understanding of impact dynamics and enhance protective systems.
