This presentation investigates the mechanisms of material deformation, failure, and energy dissipation in high/hyper-velocity impacts on magnesium alloys impacted by steel projectiles (up to 3 km/s). A high-fidelity Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model, calibrated with plasticity, fracture, and EOS models, is validated against experimental data. Parametric studies reveal critical insights into energy partitioning and failure mechanisms, guiding protective system design.
