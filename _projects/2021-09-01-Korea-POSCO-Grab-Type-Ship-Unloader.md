**Description:**  

Directed the replacement project for the No. 9 grab-type ship unloader (GTSU) at Pohang Port, overseeing comprehensive design selection for mechanical mechanisms—including detailed design and selection calculations for externally procured components such as motors, reducers, and brake discs—as well as the overall structural design. Employed finite element analysis to assess structural stability under load combinations and perform precise wheel load calculations, ensuring the equipment met user requirements while achieving optimal performance and reliability. As the lead for design and project construction, managed component-level task assignments, supervised system integration, and collaborated closely with manufacturing teams to resolve production challenges. Coordinated with the client to refine design requirements, ensure adherence to relevant standards, and successfully deliver a high-performance bulk material handling solution.
