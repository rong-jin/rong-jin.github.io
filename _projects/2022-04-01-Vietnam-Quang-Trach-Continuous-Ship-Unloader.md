**Description:**  

Led the mechanical design and implementation of a Continuous Ship Unloader (CSU), overseeing the selection and calculation of critical componentsâ€”including the drive system, chains, buckets, rotary feeder, and slewing gear. Conducted comprehensive finite element structural analyses to verify overall stability and accurately determine wheel load distributions under varied conditions, thereby optimizing performance and reliability. Facilitated the seamless integration of system components to ensure a smooth transition from design to engineering execution, proactively addressing manufacturing and installation challenges. Collaborated closely with the client to refine design parameters in line with operational requirements and maintain compliance with international standards (ISO, ANSI, ASME, etc.), ultimately delivering a high-performance and reliable bulk material unloading solution.
