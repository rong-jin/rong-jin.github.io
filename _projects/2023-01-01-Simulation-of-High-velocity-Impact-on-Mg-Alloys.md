**Description:**  

Performed SPH simulations to model projectile impacts on various magnesium alloys under adiabatic conditions, and validated simulation results against tensile tests on EDM-fabricated microtensile samples with high-speed DIC measurements. Accurately captured stress contours and backface deflections at key impact velocities, thereby revealing detailed impact dynamics.
