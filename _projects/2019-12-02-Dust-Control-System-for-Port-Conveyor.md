**Description:**  

Developed and implemented an innovative dust mitigation solution for port conveyor belts to address environmental challenges associated with bulk cargo transportation. Designed an integrated cover belt system that seals the interior of the conveyor belt while allowing the feed chute to move freely, thereby reducing dust generation during material handling. Engineered a mounting bracket for the cover belt on both sides of the conveyor structure and selected a sandwich rubber plate as the cover material, connected flexibly via a chain mechanism. Additionally, incorporated idler rollers on both sides of the feed chute to ensure smooth and precise movement along the head-shaped rubber cover.
