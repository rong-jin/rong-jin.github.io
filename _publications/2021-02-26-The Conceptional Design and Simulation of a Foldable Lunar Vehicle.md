collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2021-02-26-foldable-lunar-vehicle
excerpt: "This study presents a novel foldable lunar rover prototype capable of reducing transport volume by approximately 20% and equipped with a camera-integrated robotic arm to minimize sensors and energy use. Combining solar panels with compact nuclear batteries ensures sustained lunar operations. Simulation results from SOLIDWORKS MOTION validate the roverâ€™s folding mechanism, terrain adaptability, and obstacle-crossing performance, suggesting further enhancements through optimized suspension and automated route planning."
