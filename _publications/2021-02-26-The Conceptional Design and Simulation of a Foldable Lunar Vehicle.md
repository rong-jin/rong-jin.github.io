excerpt: "Moon exploration is an attractive research ofinterest especially along with the development of lunar vehicletechnologies in the past decades. Here, a small lunar vehicleprototype with a foldable mechanism was proposed. It can foldand unfold in the lunar environment, which can reduce the volumeby about 20%. The robotic arm of the lunar rover whichincorporates the camera into its end-effector also helps reduce thenumber of vision sensors and extra energy consumption. Besides,a combination of solar panels and compact nuclear batteries canensure the rover's endurance of operation on the moon. Inaddition, the folding process of the lunar rover, the ability to gouphill and downhill, and the ability to pass over obstacles aresimulated in SOLIDWORKS MOTION. Accordingly, twooptimization schemes, including adding more suspension systemsand automatic route planning systems, are proposed. With thedevelopment of the foldable lunar vehicle, it became possible forlarge number of lunar vehicles to be sent to the moon in one time,which also provided the basis for the commercialization of themoon landing."
