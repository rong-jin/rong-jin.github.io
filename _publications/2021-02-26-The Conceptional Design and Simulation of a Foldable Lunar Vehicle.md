excerpt: "Moon exploration is increasingly attractive, especially with recent advances in lunar vehicle technologies. A small lunar vehicle prototype with a foldable mechanism has been developed, reducing volume by 20%. Its robotic arm, with an end-effector camera, minimizes vision sensors and energy use. Solar panels and compact nuclear batteries ensure operation endurance on the moon. The rover's folding, hill-climbing, and obstacle negotiation are simulated in SOLIDWORKS MOTION. Two optimizations are proposed: additional suspension systems and automatic route planning. The foldable design allows multiple vehicles to be deployed simultaneously, paving the way for commercial moon landings."
