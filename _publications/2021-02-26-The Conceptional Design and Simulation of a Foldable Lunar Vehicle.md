collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2021-02-26-foldable-lunar-vehicle
excerpt: "This study presents a novel foldable lunar rover prototype capable of reducing the transport volume by approximately 20\% and equipped with a camera-integrated robotic arm to minimize sensors and energy use. Combining solar panels with compact nuclear batteries ensures sustained lunar operations. The simulation results of SOLIDWORKS MOTION validate the folding mechanism of the rover, the adaptability to terrain and the performance of obstacle crossing, suggesting further enhancements through optimized suspension and automated route planning."
