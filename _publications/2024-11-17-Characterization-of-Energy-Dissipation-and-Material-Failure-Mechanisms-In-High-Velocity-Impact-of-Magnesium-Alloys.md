excerpt: "This study uses smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to examine the effects of high-velocity impacts, ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 km/s, of stainless steel projectiles on magnesium alloy plates. The study is conducted using calibrated material models. The findings elucidate the main failure mechanisms, the energy dissipation pathways, and the evolution of stress and temperature. An increase in impact velocity increases the contributions of kinetic energy in the target and internal energy in the projectile, while proportionally reducing the internal energy of the target."
