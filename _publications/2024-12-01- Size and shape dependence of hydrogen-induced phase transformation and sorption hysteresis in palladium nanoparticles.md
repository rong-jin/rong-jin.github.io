excerpt: "This study proposes a computational framework integrating Diffusive Molecular Dynamics and iterative free-energy minimization to analyze hydrogen-induced phase transitions in palladium nanoparticles (3.9–15.6 nm) with diverse geometries. Results illustrate size- and shape-dependent hysteresis behaviors during hydrogen absorption and desorption, attributed to volumetric strains caused by facet orientations and heterogeneous hydrogen distributions."
