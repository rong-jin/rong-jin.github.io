excerpt: "We develop a computational framework that integrates Diffusive Molecular Dynamics with iterative free-energy minimization to investigate hydrogen-induced phase transitions in palladium nanoparticles ranging from 3.9 nm to 15.6 nm with diverse geometrical configurations. The findings demonstrate that the hysteresis gaps between the chemical potentials of hydrogen absorption and desorption exhibit a dependency on size and shape, which is directly associated with volumetric strains resulting from facet orientations and the heterogeneous distribution of hydrogen."
